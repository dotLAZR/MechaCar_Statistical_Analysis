* Looking at our figure above we can see that "Vehicle_Length" and "Ground_Clearance" provide a 'non-random' amount of varience to Miles per Gallon (MPG).
* Our intercept of slope of the data is small enough where it could be considered 0. 
* Althought there is many other factors and ways to look at how MPG is measured the current data is a great starting point to see genrally how it all correlates
