## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

![Deliv1](./Resources/Deliv1.png)

* Looking at our figure above we can see that "Vehicle_Length" and "Ground_Clearance" provide a 'non-random' amount of variance to Miles per Gallon (MPG).
* Our intercept of slope of the data is small enough where it could be considered 0. 
* Although there is many other factors and ways to look at how MPG is measured the current data is a great starting point to see generally how it all correlates 


## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils

* Looking at the graphic above, Lots 1 and 2 are withing the 100 pound varience specifications but Lot 3 is not with a varience of over 170. 


## T-Tests on Suspension Coils

* Again our data shows the only Manufacturing Lot that is significantly different from the population mean is Lot 3.  
(at a significance level of .05)
